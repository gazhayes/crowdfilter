### Crowd Filtered Investment Prospects ("Filtered Prospects")

Filtered Prospects is divided into two separate systems:

1. A traditional legal entity ("Traditional Entity") which handles all financial interaction
2. The "Crowd Filter", which aims to solve a specific problem: there are essentially infinite investment prospects but we are unable to reliably measure the value of each prospect compared to that of others.

The role of the **Traditional Entity** is to:
1. Raise capital for any purpose whenever required.
2. Receive payments from institutional users of the **Crowd Filter**.
3. Convert funds to cryptocurrency to enable frictionless distribution of micropayments to members of the **Smart Crowd**, providing members with an economic incentive to participate.
4. Fund the continuous improvement of the **Crowd Filter**

It is critical that the Traditional Entity does **not need to manage the Crowd Filter directly** as this will add overhead costs and reduce the speed that the system can adapt to its environment. Instead, the Traditional Entity creates and **continuously improves the rules** by which the **Crowd Filter manages itself**.

The Traditional Entity must ensure that there's enough funding to pay people who contribute to the Crowd Filter, but the contributors themselves **do not need to be managed** or told what to do, they just need to follow the rules. If the results we get are not accurate or targeted enough, we focus on improving the rules rather than managing the contributors.

We do the same thing for the development and continuous improvement of Crowd Filter Platform itself - the Traditional Entity needs to make sure there's enough money to pay developers etc, but the **developers don't need to be told specifically what to do**, they only need to follow the development process and the development rules.

The set of rules that everyone is following should create a type of **organism** that seeks out investment prospects, gathers all relevant data, and analyses the data to rank the investment prospects against any relevant criteria.


The **Crowd Filter** is divided into two distinct aspects:
1. The **Platform** - this is what the institutional clients AND the members of the Smart Crowd interact with.   
   1.1 The Smart Crowd consists of people who are contributing data and analysis to the Platform.   
   1.2 This includes the rules that the Smart Crowd follows, as well as the incentive structure etc.   
      - We require a well adapted and hyper-relevant incentive structure to attract:   
         - high quality and reliable **data about investment prospects**.   
         - **insider information** from the investment prospects
         - accurate **comparative analysis** of the investment prospects.   
    
    1.3 The Platform must gather feedback from institutional clients so that it can stay ahead of the curve
      - Make it easy for institutional clients to provide feedback as part of their usage - as frictionless as possible so that it doesn't actually feel like they are giving us feedback but just enjoying the platform.
      - Leverage the feedback from institutional clients such that the development process AND the data acquisition and filtering/ranking process are continuously improved to deliver more value to institutional clients. We do this by **hooking the feedback from institutional clients directly into the rules that the developers follow** as they continuously improve the Platform.
    
    1.4 The Platform must gather feedback from members of the Smart Crowd to ensure that the incentives continuously improve in accuracy
      - Again, we hook this feedback directly into the development process 
      - The rules that developers follow incorporate a mechanism by which feedback from members of the Smart Crowd results in updates to the Platform itself without any overhead caused by requiring intervention from the Traditional Entity or any kind of direct management.

2. The Technical Development of the Platform itself.  
   2.1 Build and continuously improve the Platform software - initially a web based system but could include apps etc later on.  
   2.2 The infrastructure - devops to support the platform such that it can scale.  
   2.3 The direction that Technical Development follows needs to be informed by feedback from:   
   - The Traditional Entity
   - Institutional Clients
   - Members of the Smart Crowd
   
   2.4 Must follow a rules-based development process such that:   
   - Development does not become less efficient as the team size increases (Amdahl's Law = the more you need consensus on what to build, the less efficiently you can build it)
   - Work done to improve the platform is solving real problems for real users, and not creating technical debt
   - The process makes it fun for developers to work on the project
